Its mobile marketing solution combines user offline behavior understanding and algorithms to drive in-store sales. Its performance-based marketing solution delivers relevant, personalized ads that generate in-store sales it can measure. Co-founded in 2014 by Guillaume Charhon, François Wyss and Benoit Grouchko, Teemo has 50 employees in Paris and New-York.\" [Teemo, 02](https:\/\/teemo.co\/about)   \r\n\r\n\"Founded in 2014, Databerries offers brick and mortar retailers a mobile marketing solution, refferred to as Real Life Targeting, that targets mobile users based on locations they have visited in the past and measures the impact of marketing campaigns on store visits. The solution allows retailers to target users who have visited their stores and those of their competitors. The company’s technology collects geolocation and navigation data from mobile users and targets them with relevant and personalised ads. This allows retailers to generate store visits with a significantly lower cost per physical visit (CPV). Databerries enables retailers to count the cost per visit and therefore measure the impact of a campaign on point-of-sale traffic, offering retailers a solution that works for offline marketing while combining online advertising standards such as accurate targeting, personalisation, performance measurement and return on investment optimisation.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Paris, Databerries employs 40 people and plans to double its workforce by the end of 2017. Since its launch, the solution has generated more than one million in-store visits and supports more than 20 prestigious advertisers on a daily basis. It serves more than 100 brick and mortar retailers including Carrefour, Decathlon, FNAC, Leclerc, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Volkswagen (ETR: VOW3).\r\n\r\nAccording to the company, offline retailers spend more than $100bn (€93.9bn) on advertising every year, relying largely on outdoor and other offline channels to increase store visits with limited ability to track the performance of their advertising campaigns. According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the cross-platform and mobile advertising market is estimated to grow from $25.2bn (€23.7bn) in 2015 to $80.5bn (€75.6bn) by 2020, at a CAGR of 26.1%.\" [Go4Venture, 01](http:\/\/go4venture.com\/hti\/usd-16m-a-mar-2017-databerries)\r\n\r\n_Slogans:_ \r\n* \"Real-life Targeting, Offline Measurement\" \r\n* \"Reinventing offline marketing\"\r\n\r\n_Devices:_ Android (Google Android ID) and Apple (IDFA)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* _Crunchbase, 01._ [https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/databerries](https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/databerries)\r\n* _Teemo, 01._ [http:\/\/teemo.co](http:\/\/teemo.co)  \r\n* _Teemo, 02._ [https:\/\/teemo.co\/about](https:\/\/teemo.co\/about) \r\n* _Teemo, 03._ [https:\/\/teemo.co\/sdkguidelines](https:\/\/teemo.co\/sdkguidelines)   \r\n* _Teemo, 04._ [https:\/\/teemo.co\/privacy](https:\/\/teemo.co\/privacy)\r\n\r\n## External Links\r\n* _Go4Venture, 01:_ [http:\/\/go4venture.com\/hti\/usd-16m-a-mar-2017-databerries](http:\/\/go4venture.com\/hti\/usd-16m-a-mar-2017-databerries)  \r\n* _L'Expansion, 01:_ [https:\/\/lexpansion.lexpress.fr\/high-tech\/teemo-la-start-up-qui-traque-10-millions-de-francais-en-continu_1937638.html](https:\/\/lexpansion.lexpress.fr\/high-tech\/teemo-la-start-up-qui-traque-10-millions-de-francais-en-continu_1937638.html)",

However, they \"knew that first-party data (customers’ email addresses and purchase histories) was where the puck was headed, so we doubled down on it.\"  They are driven by the concept \"people data\" because people, not browsers and mobile devices, are what buy things. [Salesforce, 1](https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/2017\/05\/krux-is-now-salesforce-dmp.html)\r\n\r\n_Philosophy and approach:_ \"...when I am asked, what is the future of DMPs, I say that DMPs will become completely integrated into larger technology stacks offering a layer of data management (for both known and unknown data) for the “right person.” This orchestration layer consists of connected execution systems that seek to answer the “right message, right time” quandary. It also includes an artificial intelligence (AI) layer, which is the “brains” of the operation trying determine how to stitch billions of individual data points together in real time.\"  \"...marketing is much more than ad campaigns. It is every experience a customer has with the brand, and we empower marketers to use data to impact every touchpoint along that journey, all powered by AI.\" [Salesforce, 1](https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/2017\/05\/krux-is-now-salesforce-dmp.html)\r\n\r\n\"Some of the core reasons to use a DMP are to manage Identity and centralize user-level data for advertising and content personalization.

Using Salesforce DMP, organizations can consolidate and reconcile their first-party \"web-behavior\" data that is generated by consumers as they engage with media and\/or content with data from various third-party data providers like eXelate, DataLogix, Targus etc. Organizations can also integrate data from their user registration and subscription databases (hereon referred to as “first-party data”) into Salesforce DMP and join that data with web behavior and third-party data. \r\n\r\nUser data stored in Salesforce DMP is keyed off a global Krux User ID. The Krux User ID is a third-party cookie and as such is specific to a browser (and corresponding device too). All data that is collected by Salesforce DMP from online environments is automatically keyed off the Krux User ID.\r\n\r\nSalesforce DMP supports the ingestion of first-party data available in client systems like registration or subscription databases and other CRM systems. This data is keyed off the client’s first-party User ID. A User Matching process that maps the client first-party User ID to the corresponding Krux User ID for every applicable user facilitates the onboarding and ingestion of this data. \r\n\r\nAfter the user matching process has been setup clients can send first-party data corresponding to the matched users. Salesforce DMP has a strict data format for the first-party data outlined below.\" [Salesforce, 32](https:\/\/konsole.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/214918988-First-Party-Data-Import)\r\n\r\n_Billing Clients:_ Clients are charged for impressions, and a maximum amount for a single impression is calculate: [Salesforce, 34](https:\/\/konsole.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115011719688-How-Data-Costs-are-Billed)\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\n\r\n**AMP for Mobile Tracking**  \r\nAMP stands for ‘Accelerated Mobile Pages’ and is designed to facilitate mobile-optimized content.

It allows you to identify and map consumers and behavior patterns consistently across all devices, screens, and platforms.\"\r\n\r\n_Key features include_: \"Connects known and unknown devices (declared and predictive) \/ Create a CDIM segment directly from the report \/ Aggregate audiences and their data across devices \/ A choice of similarity levels allows you to consider the trade off between accuracy and scale\".  _Key benefits include_: \"Improves reach, relevance, and inventory monetization \/ Increases your opportunity to sequence ads, at optimal frequency, for consistent messaging and experience across channels, throughout the journey \/ Delivers accurate analytics for segment profiles and campaign conversions?\r\n\r\n_Probablistic Matching:_  \r\n\"How does the probabilistic matching algorithm work?\r\n\r\nThe core of the model is designed to uncover the devices that stay together in various places over long periods of time. To do this effectively there are three important considerations - scale, training, and validation.\r\n\r\n* Scale - Because the success of the model is predicated on seeing lots of devices and how they move over time, it is essential to have massive reach into the device world. With one of the largest device footprints on the planet, Salesforce DMP has an advantageous position from which to deliver accurate results.\r\n* Training - Salesforce DMP uses deterministic data coming from authenticated events (logins, purchases, etc) to provide a truth set for training the algorithm.\r\n* Validation - From the deterministic data set, Salesforce DMP reserves some data to validate the efficacy of the model.\r\n\r\nBetween these three items we are able to continuously improve the accuracy of the predictions and deliver a better product.\r\n\r\nTo better understand the view of devices over time, consider a user's work and home movement. During the work day, all of the user's devices are likely to be tied to the same IP from work. However, colleagues are also tied to the same IP and in that single snapshot of time, it may be assumed the user and their colleagues are the same person.\r\n\r\nLooking at that same IP address at night, there is likely no activity, as everyone has left the office. When looking at the user's home IP at night, all of the devices that belong to that user and their family are tied to the same IP. That single snapshot might imply that the usr and their family are one \"person\".\r\n\r\n_Predicting with device composition:_ \"Device Composition: Salesforce DMP uses predictive cookie matching to fill in the gaps where cookies may not be present, such as mobile apps, Safari browser, ad blocking software, etc. However, because Google is looking for active audience cookies, the two systems use different logic around device composition. If your segment includes a high volume of non-stable cookies (mobile\/Safari\/cookie-less devices), that can impact the match rate.\" [Salesforce, 37](https:\/\/konsole.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115010886887-DFP-FAQ)\r\n\r\n\"Each user creates multiple Krux User IDs (KUIDS) - cookies in browsers as well as IDFAs or AdIDs for mobile apps. Once our cross devices algorithm identifies that two of these KUIDs belong to the same person, we increase the count of \"people\" by one and select one of the KUIDs to be the \"leading\" KUID. We call this the one the \"Uber ID\". \r\n\r\nThere are some rules in place to determine which of the KUIDs is elected the Uber ID. This evaluation can change from day to day. If the Uber ID KUID is not active for a couple of days, it loses it's status as Uber ID. In this special case, the Uber ID is removed from the segment population list and shown accordingly as \"deleted\". \r\n\r\nIt is mainly Safari users to contribute to these Uber ID changes, as on Safari each page impression created a unique new KUID.\" [Salesforce, 54](https:\/\/konsole.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115006652948-Segment-Processing-FAQ)\r\n\r\n**Salesforce DMP Einstein**   \r\n\"Salesforce DMP Einstein Segmentation, which allows marketers to use machine learning to discover the multiple distinct personas that exist within their audience.\r\n\r\nUsing Einstein AI, on top of unified consumer data from both first and third-party sources, enables us to algorithmically determine the “personas” that best define a brand’s audience. Now, companies can personalize marketing and reach each key persona with a message that is going to resonate, rather than blasting a one-size-fits-all retargeting message to everyone that happened to land on a particular webpage. For example, Conagra Brands has seen dramatic results by customizing the messages to different consumer personas for its Hunt’s brand.\r\n\r\nThis is a great example of how our data management layer consisting of first, second, and third-party data can feed our growing AI layer to create tangible value for marketers\" [Salesforce, 1](https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/blog\/2017\/05\/krux-is-now-salesforce-dmp.html)\"\r\n\r\n**Tracking**    \r\n_Device strategies & KUIDs:_ \"We differentiate between Mobile Web and Mobile App. Mobile work works just like Desktop Web with KUIDs stored as 3rd Party cookies.

Match rate is the percentage of users of party A known by party B.  SF DMP match rates exclude Safari and app IDs.  Increased match rates create greater scale, and \"Greater audience scale creates more options for managing and optimizing campaign tactics such as segmentation, personalized messaging, frequency, omni channel journey, etc.\"  Because of 3rd party blocking, **Safari users can typicaly not be matched to partners at all.** \r\n\r\n\"By default, we run user match pixels on client’s websites through the Control Tag for all partners a client is working with. We fire it on all pages with a frequency cap of 3 times over a 24-hour period for a given user. This will ensure return users are matched, but will not overwhelm client’s sites with unnecessary tag fires. We set the tag to fire \"immediately\" to make sure users are matched before leaving the page. \r\n\r\nIt will take up to 30 days for the match rate to reach its peak after a new user match pixel has been activated.\r\n\r\nUnlike first party data that is exclusively available to the client who owns it, user match tables are shared across all Salesforce DMP clients. This way, each client can benefit from the user match pixels being fired on other client’s websites.\r\n\r\nSalesforce has one of the largest footprints in the industry, thus providing exceptionally high match rates. Match rates can vary from country to country though, depending on both Salesforce's and the partner’s footprint in that market.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible for partners to fire the Salesforce DMP user match pixel across all their inventory to improve the match rate upon request.\" [Salesforce, 23](https:\/\/konsole.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115006072448-User-Matching-and-Match-Rates-FAQ)\r\n\r\nCritically, \"The Client User ID will have a one-to-many relationship with the Krux User ID in the User Match table. Note that in general, there may be multiple Krux User IDs mapped to a given Client User ID because the Krux User ID is browser specific whereas the Client User ID will be the same across multiple browsers (assuming that it is indeed a persistent user ID as opposed to a first-party cookie).\"\r\n\r\n\"For example, if there are 3 columns called Age Group, Gender, and Interest in the client’s registration database that need to be imported into Salesforce DMP, then the following represents a valid data file that can be ingested by Salesforce DMP:\r\n\r\nUser1234^gender:male;age:18-24;interest:fishing\r\nUser2345^gender:female\r\nUser3456^age:35-44\r\nUser4567^gender:male;interest:fishing,boating\r\n\r\nWhen Salesforce DMP processes this file, we will create 3 attributes called Gender, Age, and Interest in the client’s Salesforce DMP account.

This includes Safari cookies, as per default Safari deleted all cookies after each page impression. A DSP Safari cookie will never show up again and thus can't be served ads to.

Weborama recorded revenues of 24.3 million Euros in 2012 [Weborama, 03](http:\/\/www.weborama.com\/documents\/2013\/06\/data-according-to-weborama.pdf); revenues \"reached €29 million in 2016\" [Weborama, 05](https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/infos-financieres\/financial-figures).  Operating income was up in early 2017.  A recently signed international agreement with \"a leading media\/marketing player...will especially enable Weborama to grow its presence in the United States.\" [Weborama, 06](https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/documents\/2017\/09\/weborama-growth-of-the-operating-profit-in-the-first-half-of-2017.pdf)\r\n\r\n_Growth:_ Weborama had 110 million profiles in 2013; this suggests a growth of 300 million profiles in just 4 years [Weborama, 03](http:\/\/www.weborama.com\/documents\/2013\/06\/data-according-to-weborama.pdf); [Weborama, 07](https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/e-privacy\/our-commitment)\r\n\r\n_Devices:_ Web browsers \/ Trackers in mobile apps\r\n\r\n### Methods\r\n_Data assets:_ Weborama has \"400 million profiles in the European database\" and \"More than 200 socio-demo, behavioural and intenders criteria\". This is used for \"data solutions\" for advertisers; the Audience Manager gives \"an exclusive and native access to 400 million profiles in Europe\" with a \"360° view of behavioural and socio-demographic data\".  Audience Insight \"allows viewing the audience structure by age, gender and occupation, along with the distribution of behavioural segments and clusters\", which \"helps publishers to drill down into their audience profile in real time, and thereby to maximise its monetisation\" [Weborama, 04](https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/data\/the-offering).\r\n\r\nWeborama tags placed on a publisher's website allows them to \"collect raw and anonymous navigation data\".

Big Data is the driver of development today at Weborama, and will continue to be in the future. Great cares are taken to collect data anonymously, internet user benefits from more relevant advertising.\" [Weborama, 02](https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/data\/presentation)\r\n\r\n_Semantic processing: Cookies, segmenting, & survey:_ \"the data is sourced anonymously from 300,000 sites, using cookies, then processed instantly. this audience classification is a critical process within each database. thanks to this methodology Weborama has a database of 110 million profiles of behavioural, socio-demographic, and purchasing intent data in Europe, 70 million of which are from France. Today, Weborama has identified almost 200 clusters (centres of interest) based on the behaviour of internet users, divided into 23 segments (a segment being a “family” of clusters). Weborama’s socio-demographic database is built from a sample group of 300,000 active internet users in France who responded willingly to a questionnaire giving their age, gender and socio-professional category. by cross-referencing  behavioural clusters with Weborama’s socio-demographic sample group, the sample group data are extrapolated from the database as a whole\" [Weborama, 03](http:\/\/www.weborama.com\/documents\/2013\/06\/data-according-to-weborama.pdf).\r\n\r\n_Patented technologies based on algorithms and the automatic processing of language:_ 33 million active URLs; 300,000 sites analysed each day; 110 million active profiles per month; 3.5 million qualified internet users per day; 25 words per day per internet user.\" [Weborama, 03](http:\/\/www.weborama.com\/documents\/2013\/06\/data-according-to-weborama.pdf)  \r\n\r\n_Knowledge: 3rd party & 1st party data:_ The Weborama 3rd party database enriches 1st party data.  3rd party data is \"Data from a third party which do not belong to the advertiser or publisher, but are made available to them for deployment in online marketing\", whereas 1st party data is \"Data belonging to an advertiser or publisher.\"\r\n\r\n_Audience Segmentation & Targeted Advertising:_ With big data collections, Weborama can identify \"look-alikes\" of internet users with a similar profile to those who \"transform\" (\"subscriptions to products offered in the campaign\").  \"This allows them to be offered advertising which is personalised to fit their profile\".  Audience segmentation in media campaigns was introducted by an advertiser in 2012; the advertiser was looking to increase the level of transformation while reducing loss of media investments, and called upon Weborama to build a mechanism for its commercial catalogue.  Weborama creates a database, including from data collected by advertisers, and builds a targeted advertising model, which includes a model training phase and A\/B testing.  \r\n\r\nData mining is conducted as follows: \"this database is then enriched with socio-demographic and behavioural criteria for internet users whose profile is known to Weborama, thanks to their database of 70 million qualified profiles in France. this data is cross referenced with the data coming from Weborama Campaign Manager. this anonymous information is accessible as a whole using the internet user identifier (a series of characters for each individual contained in the cookies deposited in the internet explorer). this unique identifier allows Weborama to find the complete profile of the internet user in their database, in real time.\"  Search and surf data is used; Weborama then views transactions over weeks, and observes outcomes from users in the database which includes 60 million qualified profiles over approximatley 300 columns, including ads viewed, reactions (visit, click), behavior on the website visited, and socio-demographic and behavioral profile.    \r\n\r\nTraining the model is conducted as follows: From the database, build graphic representation and create permanent tree segments. The criteria most relevant to each product or service can be extracted, where the criteria is based on transformation of the internet users exposed to ad campaigns and impressions.\r\n\r\nWeborama's database \"is then enriched with socio-demographic and behavioural criteria for internet users whose profile is known to Weborama, thanks to their database of 70 million qualified profiles in France. this data is cross-referenced with the data coming from Weborama Campaign Manager. this anonymous information is accessible as a whole using the internet user identifier (a series of characters for each individual contained in the cookies deposited in the internet explorer). this unique identifier allows Weborama to find the complete profile of the internet user in their database, in real time.\" \r\n\r\nWeborama runs A\/B testing to determine if the model is working, based on confidence intervals.  Variation can occur for many reasons, such as a calendar event or a holiday. \r\n\r\n_Segmentation for publishers:_ \"Above all, the aim of publishers is to organise their commercial products so that they can offer advertisers and agencies, in addition to the contextual menu, packs of targeted audiences, enriched by 3rd party data. the second challenge is to build specific audience packs using ad hoc target segments based on both socio-demographic and behavioural targeting (taking account of the internet users’ different areas of interest).  \"Segmentation of a site’s audience allows visitor profiles \r\nfrom other areas of interest to be seen. It is highly probable that a current affairs site has, among its audience, people who enjoy other sites (finance, beauty, fashion, cookery, travel...). this will offer the publishers the possibility of assessing their content quality, as well as that of their audience, while expanding their client base. \" \r\n\r\n_Two methods of data enrichment from publishers:_ The first method \"includes the synchronisation and propagation of Weborama’s socio-demographic criteria and behavioural clusters on the publisher’s site audience. this is possible by identifying profiles recognised within the site’s audience, which are already part of the Weborama database. In this particular case, the adserver of the publisher calls the Weborama database for each internet user. If the Weborama database recognises the socio-demographic profile or behaviour of the visitor to the site, the visitor is transferred to the publisher’s adserver. the publisher’s adserver therefore now contains the socio-demographic and behavioural profile of the majority of its internet users.\"  \r\n\r\nThe second method \"identifies and analyses the website user’s profiles to create ad hoc target users relevant to the advertisers’ areas of activity.\"  Here Weborama creates _ad hoc_ profiles, and then there is a \"transfer of ad hoc target users\": \"the transfer of ad hoc users defined above is possible using a list of different adserver pixels. this transfer is done by a call of the pixels generated by the publisher’s adserver. the volume of profiles per target required are then available directly in the adserver\" [Weborama, 03](http:\/\/www.weborama.com\/documents\/2013\/06\/data-according-to-weborama.pdf).\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* _Crunchbase, 01._ [https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/weborama](https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/weborama)\r\n* _Weborama, 01._ [https:\/\/www.weborama.com](https:\/\/www.weborama.com)\r\n* _Weborama, 02._ [https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/data\/presentation](https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/data\/presentation)  \r\n* _Weborama, 03._ [http:\/\/www.weborama.com\/documents\/2013\/06\/data-according-to-weborama.pdf](http:\/\/www.weborama.com\/documents\/2013\/06\/data-according-to-weborama.pdf)  \r\n* _Weborama, 04._ [https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/data\/the-offering](https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/data\/the-offering)  \r\n* _Weborama, 05._ [https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/infos-financieres\/financial-figures](https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/infos-financieres\/financial-figures)  \r\n* _Weborama, 06._ [https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/documents\/2017\/09\/weborama-growth-of-the-operating-profit-in-the-first-half-of-2017.pdf](https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/documents\/2017\/09\/weborama-growth-of-the-operating-profit-in-the-first-half-of-2017.pdf)  \r\n* _Weborama, 07._ [https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/e-privacy\/our-commitment](https:\/\/www.weborama.com\/e-privacy\/our-commitment)\r\n \r\n## External Links\r\n* _Wikipedia (Weborama, French):_ [https:\/\/fr.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weborama](https:\/\/fr.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weborama)  \r\n* _Wikipedia (Weborama, English translation):_ [https:\/\/translate.google.com\/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=https:\/\/fr.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weborama&prev=search](https:\/\/translate.google.com\/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=https:\/\/fr.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Weborama&prev=search)",

Minor press about Tinder and \"swiping right\" offers clues:\r\n\r\n\"Earlier this year, to combat this collection of overzealous swipers, the company set a limit on the number of right swipes users could make daily. Then it rounded up profiles of the most prolific right-swipers and watched what happened. Would they get upset and leave? Would they stop using for a while and lick their wounds? Or would they realize the error in their ways and be a little more discriminating in suggesting possible hookups?\" [Fortune, 01](http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/09\/29\/tinder-interana-analytics\/)\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\nThe privacy policy for the Tinder Analytics SDK tracker is not public.

It is explained as follows:  \r\n\r\n\"Within the TMC, two features allow advertisers to use data to target advertising to an end user:\r\n\r\n1. AUDIENCES allows Advertisers to build segments based on previously acquired attribution data (from the TMC's Attribution Analytics feature)...\r\n2. IN APP MARKETING allows advertisers to send end users push notifications outside of the app environment, as well as in-app messages - for promotional and other activities...\" [TUNE, 09](http:\/\/www.optoutmobile.com).\r\n\r\nIn this context, TMC covers \"Attribution Analytics, App Store Analytics, Audiences, and In-App Marketing\" [TUNE, 10](https:\/\/www.tune.com\/resources\/data-and-privacy\/privacy-policies\/tmc-privacy-policy).\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\nTUNE \"defines privacy as the end user’s rights to receive notice, give consent, and opt-out of the collection, use, and sharing of data that is about or can identify that end user\".\r\n\r\n_Opt-out:_ TUNE has an opt-out website, www.optoutmobile.com, which details how end users can opt out of features in the TUNE Marketing Console (TMC) that target users online. Users can opt out of the \"audiences\" segment-based targeted advertising if they \"enable Limit Ad Tracking or “LAT” or re-set their ad identifier on their device OR opt out within the app itself\". They can opt out of \"in app marketing\" if they \"use the appropriate settings on their mobile platform (Android, iPhone, or Windows)\". Additional details of how to opt out of mobile on the outoutmobile.com website.  TUNE will pass on LAT requests to Advertisers, and will honor opt-outs provided to them by Advertisers. They also honor push notification opt outs set by the End User on their device.  \r\n\r\nOpting out of the TMC \"will not stop those users from receiving interest-based advertisements from Advertisers or other publishers or ad networks. End Users who want to opt out of a particular ad network, publisher, or Advertiser’s ads must contact those companies directly to opt out.\"\r\n\r\n_Data ownership (TMC):_ \"Unless otherwise specified, and pursuant to the TUNE Data Pledge, Advertisers own the data that they provide to and collect through the TMC. When Advertisers remove or export their data from the TMC, their use of End User data is governed by their own privacy policies and applicable laws, rules, or regulations.\"    \r\n\r\n_Data collected (TMC):_ The TMC \"is designed to collect and use data such as Unique Advertising Identifiers, Statistical Identifiers, Geographic Location Data, Email Addresses, and other data provided by the Advertiser for attribution, app store optimization, and in-app marketing.\"  \r\n\r\n_Data sharing (TMC):_ Advertisers \"are able to view and measure data provided by TUNE, as well as third-party Partners that the Advertiser selects, in the TMC. For instance, an Advertiser can compare the results of advertising campaigns conducted with different Partners in the TMC. Advertisers and Partners may also send information to the TMC via Postback\"... Advertisers can share all data collected through the TMC with Partners via Postback, data exports, and\/or API calls\". TUNE itself may provide or disclose, or enable others to provide, End User Data for the purposes of detecting and preventing malicious activity of invalid traffic, or believe that we are legally required to do so.\"   \r\n\r\n_Personally identifiable information:_ \"The TMC does not primarily rely on data that is considered “personal” in other jurisdictions for Attribution and App Store Optimization. The TMC does support automatic hashing in cases where the Advertiser chooses to upload “personal” data into the TMC to ensure that the TMC does not process such data in raw form\".

Developers can build location-enabled features into their apps and \"maintain complete control over how end-user data is collected, where it is stored, and which APIs it will be sent to\". This includes sending to storage services (like Amazon S3) or APIs (such as Google Places API or SafeGraph's Places API) [SafeGraph, 05](https:\/\/blog.safegraph.com\/introducing-openlocate-the-open-source-location-sdk-f5c5d2739a48).\r\n\r\nOther services include:\r\n* \"Detailed polygon maps on 50+ million U.S. places of interest\r\n* Understanding of each business's popularity, taxonomy, hours, etc.\r\n* Core investments in benchmarking via truth sets\"\r\n  * This includes Explicit Truth Sets (Check-ins, Daily diaries, Web surveys) and Implicit Truth Sets (Credit card data, Receipt data, First-party transactions) \r\n\r\nData from visits may include:\r\n\r\n* _Core truth set for matching:_\r\n  * High-res GPS data\r\n  * Deterministic data\r\n  * Explicit and implicit truth\r\n  * Data collected in background from large population\r\n* _Deep places map:_\r\n  * Best polygons\r\n  * Footprint geometries\r\n  * Metadata\r\n  * Categories\r\n  * Hours of operation\r\n* Machine learning technology\r\n  * Cross-validated against multiple independent 3rd party truth sets about where people go\r\n* _Truth and accuracy_\r\n  * High Precision \/\/ Low false positive rate; High recall \/\/ Low false negative rate\" [SafeGraph, 06](https:\/\/www.safegraph.com\/truth)\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\n_Data collection (method and use):_ SafeGraph collects data from \"trusted third-party data partners such as mobile application developers, through APIs and other delivery methods\". The data collection and use is \"governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by SafeGraph.\" SafeGraph \"aggregates data collected from our data partners, and allows third party customers to access the Data for a variety of purposes such as ad targeting, traffic analysis, and market research.\" SafeGraph may also use data for their own \"internal and operational purposes\", and share data in response to requests from law enforcement or a governmental agency, \"to protect or enforce our rights or those of others, or to investigate potential wrongdoing.\"  Data can also be transferred to a successor entity in the event of a merger or acquisition.\r\n\r\n_Information collected:_ Information collected includes \"data regarding a device’s precise geographic location, as well as other mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFAs and Google Android IDs, and other information about users and their devices.\"  \r\n\r\n_Jurisdictions:_ \"SafeGraph stores and processes information on servers in many countries around the world. We therefore may process your information on a server located outside the country where you live... Our customers (or companies that help us process the Data) may be located in other countries, so the Data we provide may be processed or used in a variety of countries, other than those our users reside in.\"  Customers of SafeGraph may create cross-device capabilities \"to enable marketers to target users across various channels and devices.\"\r\n\r\n_Opt-out:_ SafeGraph informs users of opt-out procedures for interest-based advertising and location tracking.  To opt out of interest-based advertising, they state, users can adjust settings in their Android or iOS devices.

Access to the data that these measurement providers need could mean having code for multiple providers on one site or app. IAB’s Open Measurement project was initiated to develop a scalable solution that minimizes code used to provide data to measurement providers.\r\n\r\nThe IAB Open Measurement SDK (OM SDK) offers common code and libraries for facilitating third-party access to measurement data. Sites and apps that integrate the OM SDK can send measurement signals to an API, the Open Measurement Interface Definition (OMID). Measurement providers can place tags that collect these signals.\r\n\r\nWhile Open Measurement relies on the OM SDK and OMID during operation, IAB Tech Lab offers several resources to encourage adoption across the industry.",

APP can fully schedule system resources such as CPU frequency, core size, GPU frequency, etc. to improve APP performance. The system can obtain more information from the APP side to provide various system resources more reasonably. At the same time, for functions that Android lacks standard interfaces, APP and system can also realize model adaptation and function expansion through this framework."
